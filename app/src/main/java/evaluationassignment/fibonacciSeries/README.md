# Fibonacci Series Generator

- This Java program generates the **Fibonacci series** up to a specified number of terms entered by the user.

## 📘 What is a Fibonacci Series?

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence of numbers where:
- The first two numbers are `0` and `1`
- Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones

Example:
```

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

```

## 🚀 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter the number of terms (`limit`) they want in the Fibonacci series.
- Generates the sequence using an iterative method.
- Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers and prints them in tab-separated format.
